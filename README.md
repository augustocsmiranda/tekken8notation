## Usage
1. Download the latest release `.zip` archive from the Releases section.
2. Unpack into a folder of your choice.
3. Launch via the `Notation Image Generator.exe`

## Functionality
- Press the move button to add it to an image. Use `Backspace` to remove the last image and `Clear` to start from scratch. Clicking `Save as PNG` will create an image file in the app's folder.
- Select the `Character` from the drop-down menu to bring up their specific moves (character portrait is also a button!).
- Hover over a "text" button to see a tooltip with the full name of the move.
- Enable the `Include dark notation` option to also generate a dark version of the notation image (useful if you want to mimic the in-game "play demo" visuals for combo notation).
- Change the `Button style` to customize the look of the buttons in the notation (see examples of available button styles below).
